# Matrix Multiplication Mentor

I participated in [3Blue1Brown's (a math content creator) contest](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1)
and put some math-related learning material on the world wide web.

My topic of choice is matrix multiplication, a staple of matrices. Furthermore, the topic is often mediocre explained and thus often confusing to students. The little mentor offers a concise tutorial including a rarely taught method that makes the calculation fairly easy and an open-ended mode of increasingly difficult, generated practice exercises.
Quickly stapled together in Vue.js. Live here: <https://blackbrokkoli.github.io/summer-of-math-2021/>
