description: Summer Of Math 2021 â€” My experience building a small software project and publishing it.
---

I wanted to start this blog for years, but somehow, I never could. I encountered resistance. Of course, that was neither surprising nor new, but the levels of it were quite staggering.

In the end, external motivation did the trick. [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), a math content creator I sporadically follow, put out a contest. Called [The Summer of Math Exposition](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1), it urged people to put out math content, especially new-comers.

There I was: Two days 'til deadline, very mediocre math proficiency, and no plan. But I had a very real anchor to actually *write* a blog post, and with a time frame, too! Remembering that I actually had other stuff on my plate as well, I shortened my time frame even further to a single day and got to build. And I got a result! Taking on the topic of matrix multiplication, something I struggled with when I took Math 101, I built a small online trainer. Check it out [here](https://blackbrokkoli.github.io/summer-of-math-2021/).

A more detailed write-up on the project itself will follow. This post is more of a commitment to myself and the world. Is there a lesson to be learned? I think that judgment should be held until the number of posts either hit double-digits or stall. We will see, but I'm eager and anxious to finally be on this journey.
